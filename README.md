# Fallout Hacker
Repo for my attempts at creating a hacking tool for the Fallout4 terminals.
I was generally dissapointed in the performance of the ones I found online, so I cobbled one together until I was bored with it. 
It has been re-written in JS after the original was written Python since I wanted it to be more portable.

The JavaScript version can be run in the browser at:
